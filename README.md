# Assembly X86_64 Calculator

Simple calculator with the operators [**+ - x /**], implemented purely with assembly instruction without any stdlib functions. The project is intended to be a challenge and not a substitute for more stable programs that are implemented by subroutines that have been tested and refined over a long period of time.

### Current TODO:

* Implement the calculator to work with the IEEE-754 standard for floating point numbers
* Add the exponential and root operator
* Add bracket functionality
* Perform more tests to ensure, that the calculator is properly working
